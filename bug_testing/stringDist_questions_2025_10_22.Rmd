# Issues to look at, 2025/10/22 

Using pwalign_1.4.0 and Biostrings_2.76.0 (these are both the current release version) 

[Issue 1](https://github.com/Bioconductor/pwalign/issues/15): can StringDist handle gaps?

[Issue 2](https://github.com/Bioconductor/pwalign/issues/14): weird scores on the diagonal

The two plain R docs stringDist_questions_2025_10_22.issue1.R and stringDist_questions_2025_10_22.issue2.R are useful to make reprex.  After loading `library(reprex)`, you can highlight the code you want as a reprex, copy it into the clipboard, and type `reprex()` on the console. 


## Setup 

```{r setup, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(Biostrings)
library(pwalign)
library(here)
data(BLOSUM62)
```


Make small test alignments. `x` has no gaps, `y` has a gap.

```{r}
aln_no_gaps <-  AAStringSet(c(seq1="VF",
                              seq2="VF",
                              seq3="LF"))

aln_with_gap <-  AAStringSet(c(seq1="VF",
                               seq2="V-",
                               seq3="LF"))
```

## Issue 1: can StringDist handle gaps?

stringDist works fine on the gapped alignment with default method (levenshtein)

```{r}
stringDist(aln_with_gap,
           diag=TRUE, upper=TRUE)
```


substitutionMatrix method does work without gaps:

```{r}
stringDist(aln_no_gaps, 
           diag=TRUE, upper=TRUE,
           method="substitutionMatrix",
           substitutionMatrix=BLOSUM62)
```


But substitutionMatrix method gives an error when there's a gap. Maybe the gap penalties are not being handled:

```{r, error=TRUE}
stringDist(aln_with_gap, 
           diag=TRUE, upper=TRUE,
           method="substitutionMatrix",
           substitutionMatrix=BLOSUM62)
```



## Issue 2: inconsistent scores on the diagonal

seq1 and seq2 are identical to each other. Therefore the scores for seq1-versus-seq1 and seq1-versus-seq2 should be identical to each other.  But they're not.  Self-matches always get a score of 0. This makes sense for many distance metrics but maybe not for substitutionMatrix methods.

```{r}
stringDist(aln_no_gaps, 
           diag=TRUE, upper=TRUE,
           method="substitutionMatrix",
           substitutionMatrix=BLOSUM62)
```
Just to make sure I understand how the off-diagonal scores come about, here are the relevant bits of the BLOSUM62 matrix:

```{r}
BLOSUM62[c("F","L","V"),c("F","L","V")]
```


Understanding the scores:

- VF aligned to VF scores -10, because BLOSUM62 scores F-F as 6 and V-V as 4 
- VF aligned to LF score -7, because BLOSUM62 scores F-F as 6 and V-L as 1

# Herve's workaround

https://github.com/Bioconductor/pwalign/issues/15

I put his new functions in `useful_functions/multiple_sequence_alignments_functions.R`

```{r}
source(here("useful_functions/multiple_sequence_alignments_functions.R"))
```



```{r}
x <- c("ARND", "AR-D", "CRNA")
x1 <- c(x, x[1:2])
x1 %>% 
    AAStringSet()
```

```{r}
alignedStringDistMatrix(x1)
```

```{r}
alignedStringDistMatrix(x1, indel.weight=10)
```

```{r}
alignedStringDistMatrix(x1, indel.weight=0)
```

```{r}
alignedStringDistMatrix(x1, weightmat=-BLOSUM62)
```

# Finished

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
