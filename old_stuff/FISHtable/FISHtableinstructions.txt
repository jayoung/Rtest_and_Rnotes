1. output a data table (or several) from Quantrix/Excel, save each as tab-delimtied text. Only one table per file.

2. transfer to fred/bedrock, ensure line breaks are in unix format

3. (optional) make a file called probecolors.txt specifying the colors for some or all of the probes. this file is tab-delimited and looks something like this:
-----------
probe1	red
probe2	skyblue
-----------
R provides many many colors - see this file for the full list:
/home/btrask/traskdata/lib/R/doc/Rcolors.txt


4. run the script on one or more data table:
plotFishTable.pl FISHtest1.txt FISHtest2.txt
Output files are in postscript format
FISHtest1.txt.balloonplot.ps   FISHtest2.txt.balloonplot.ps

(we can modify plot sizes etc if the table looks too small/big)
