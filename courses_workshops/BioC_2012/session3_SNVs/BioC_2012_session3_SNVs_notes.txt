### gmapR - can access most of GMAP and GSNAP suite inside R.  Can also do many of these things on the command line

### GSNAP SNP tolerant aligner (include known SNP annotation), allows splicing, can use splice annotation and find novel splices


can now use yieldSize arg on bamfile/scanBam to get first 100 (or whatever) reads

applyPileups  gets info about particular positions in bam file
PileupParam

common SNP-calling methods rely on assumptions e.g. diploid, with 50-50 freqs

GATK assumes only two haplotypes

begin by calling variants, don't try to make het/hom call (genotype call)

also special methods for comparing two samples

artefacts:

RNAseq:  cDNA made using random hexamers, so introduce changes in first and last 6bp

some variants introduced by mismapping to paralogous locations, especially if there are SNPs 

ghost variants only seen in reads from one strand even if coverage is good on both strands


typical pipeline:
- only uniquely mapped reads (tolerance for secondary maych - 2 mismatch)
- mapq < 13 filter
- alleles must have >= 2 reads, one of q>22
- alleles must be supported by multiple reads in multiple different positions per read (does bias against calling SNPs near start/end of transcript)
- fisher exact test to look for strand bias of alternate allele
- remove variants only seen iin first or last 10% of any read
- variants with <4% reads as non-reference filtered out

another method:   varScan2 (a couple of additional filters)
