end of tutorial looks at junction counts

leeBamViews data = yeast, two WT, two RLP mutants 36bp single-end reads, bam files extracted to contain just certain region of chrXIII 
one weirdness of different versions of sacCer2 UCSC versus BioC package - one chr is 1bp different length?!?!?!

readGappedAlignments is workhorse - gives GappedAlignment

need to use grglist to do overlap computations - gives a GRangesList

plot(hist(width(reads_ga)))

fragment length can cause some big bias.  coverage at ends can be reduced (edge effects) problematic for short genes.  probability of hitting various portions of gene depends on fragment length.


ALDOA data:  ALDOA gene, tumor and normal matched bam files, 75mer paired end


### class to deal with paired ends:
readGappedAlignmentPairs

first(x) last(x) ### by order in bam file
left(x) right(x) ### by position in genome
grglist(x) # grouped by read pair
introns(x)




#### isoform counting

compatibility and uniquenesss

compatible = agrees completely with annotated gene model
unique = agrees completely with only one annotated gene model
