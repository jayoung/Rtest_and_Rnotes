# Learn about unit testing in R.

Resources:
- [intro to testthat](https://coding-for-reproducible-research.github.io/CfRR_Courses/short_courses/r_unit_testing.html)
- [testthat docs](https://testthat.r-lib.org/)
- more complex information included in a [guide to making R packages](https://r-pkgs.org/testing-basics.html)
- maybe the [`exampletestr` package](https://rorynolan.github.io/exampletestr/) will help me generate those tests?
I'd use the `testthat` package, which has functions like `expect_equal`, `expect_error`, `expect_warning`, etc
