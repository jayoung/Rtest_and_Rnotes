Let's say we want to display a tree in a particular order - rotate nodes as much as we can to match that order

Demo code found [here](http://blog.phytools.org/2015/04/finding-closest-set-of-node-rotations.html)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(phytools)
```

original `tree` object has tips in alphabetical order 

```{r}
tree <- pbtree(n=26,tip.label=LETTERS)
plotTree(tree)
```

Rotate the tree randomly 100 times
```{r}
nn <- sample(1:tree$Nnode+Ntip(tree),100,replace=TRUE)
for(i in 1:length(nn)) {
    tree<-read.tree(text=write.tree(rotate(tree,nn[i])))
}
plotTree(tree)
```

get the tree original order
```{r, include=FALSE}
x <- setNames(1:Ntip(tree),LETTERS)
# minRotate is noisy
unscrambled <- minRotate(tree,x)
```
```{r}
plotTree(unscrambled)
```
