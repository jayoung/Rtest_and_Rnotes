Some thought experiments about non-parametric statistical tests.  Phoebe and I were trying to think about how to deal with her MIC data (antibiotic resistance).

MIC data is discrete data, and censored.  Mann-Whitney is too conservative because it doesn't account for the extent of change.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

What's the power of a test of n=3 versus n=3?

Three (tied) values versus three other (tied values)

```{r}
x1 <- c(3,3,3)
y1 <- c(10,10,10)
wilcox.test(x1,y1)
```

It makes no difference to the p-value what the magnitude of the effect is:

```{r}
z1 <- c(100,100,100)
wilcox.test(x1,z1)
```

Reducing the ties changes the p-values:

```{r}
x1a <- c(3,3,4)
y1a <- c(10,10,10)
wilcox.test(x1a,y1a)
```

Increase power by going from n=3 to n=4

```{r}
x2 <- c(3,3,3,3)
y2 <- c(10,10,10,10)
wilcox.test(x2,y2)
```
